    \subsection{Introduction}
An employee management system is a software application that helps organizations manage their workforce efficiently. It includes features like tracking employee information, managing time and attendance, performance evaluations, benefits administration, payroll, and more. This system streamlines HR processes, reduces administrative burden, and increases productivity by enabling managers to make informed decisions based on real-time data. The purpose of this project report is to provide an overview of an employee management system that has been developed for a specific organization. The report will include a description of the system's features, benefits, and implementation process. It will also discuss the challenges faced during development, how they were overcome, and provide recommendations for future improvements. The organization for which this system was developed is a medium-sized business with around 100 employees. Before the implementation of this system, they were using a manual process for managing employee data, which was time-consuming and error-prone. With the implementation of this system, the organization was able to automate their HR processes, reduce paperwork, and ensure accurate data management. Overall, this project report aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the employee management system and its benefits to organizations. It will also serve as a guide for organizations looking to implement a similar system in the future.
\subsection{Overview}
Due too many data and paperwork that needed to record the employee data could consume a lot of space in the filling cabinet. The retrieval of data can time consuming because it must be searched from the filling cabinet. This will cause waste of resource in term of time and money. In addition, it would also cause inconvenience and ineffectiveness in daily work. Plus, the manger will face difficulties when need to update employee working schedule, report and leave request. In the employee point of view, when they need to request for leave, they need to fill in a leave request form manually and submit to manager personally and wait for confirmation, this is time consuming. Other than that, if there are any changes in working schedule, employee might have wrong information in the working schedule because the schedule might not update immediately, therefore the employee might not satisfy with the working schedule.
\subsection{Problem}
Manual handling of employee information poses a number of challenges. This is evident in procedures such as leave management where an employee is required to fill in a form which may take several weeks or months to be approved. The use of paper work in handling some of these processes could lead to human error, papers may end up in the wrong hands and not forgetting the fact that this is time consuming. A number of current systems lack employee self-service meaning employees are not able to access and manage their personal information directly without having to go through their HR departments or their managers. Another challenge is that multi-national companies will have all the employee information stored at the headquarters of the company making it difficult to access the employee information from remote places when needed at short notice. The aforementioned problems can be tackled by designing and implementing a web-based HR management system. This system will maintain employee information in a database by fully privacy and authority access. The project is aimed at setting up employee information system about the status of the employee, the educational background and the work experience in order to help monitor the performance and achievement of the employee through a password protected system. This reportâ€™s documentation goes through the whole process of both application program and database development. It also comprises the development tools h have been utilized for these purposes. This system should consist of an application program, on one hand, and a database (repository of data) on the other. The program should perform the basic operations upon the database as retrieving, inserting, updating and deleting data.
\subsection{Objective}
