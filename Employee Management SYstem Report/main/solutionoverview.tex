\subsection{DFD -Data Flow Diagram}
A context level diagram is a type of Data Flow Diagram (DFD) that provides a high-
level overview of a system or process. It illustrates the interactions between the
system and its external entities, such as users, other systems, or organizations. The
context level diagram shows only one process, represented by a single bubble, and
the entities that interact with it, represented by rectangles.

\subsection{Use case Diagram}
A Use Case Diagram is a type of behavioral diagram in the Unified Modeling Language
(UML) used to visualize the functional requirements of a system from the perspective
of its users. It provides a high-level view of the interactions between users (actors)
and the system, depicting how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals
or tasks.

\subsection{ER Diagram}
ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram is a graphical representation of entities and
their relationships in a database. It helps to model and design databases by
identifying the different types of data and relationships between them.
